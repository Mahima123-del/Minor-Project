Uttarakhand has hundreds of small and large rivers which are clean, hence, the water is used for irrigation and offers a wide variety of water activities to tourists.

Ramganga originates in the Doodhatoli ranges of the Himalayas and flows out south-west to pass through the Corbett. River Ramganga is inhabited by key aquatic species like mahseer fish, endangered gharials, mugger crocodiles, and turtles, while River Kosi flows in proximity to the park near Dhikuli which is a tourist hub. Just like the river Ramganga, the Kosi too is inhabited by mahseer and attracts migratory birds.

            Jim Corbett National Park would not have existed without the Ramganga River since it is critical and the biggest of the valuable sources of water in the Jim Corbett. Ramganga River is a rain-nourished river which originates from Gairsain in the Lower Himalayas and navigates more than 100 km before entering Corbett which is close to Marchula valley. Inside the Jim Corbett, Ramganga River streams approximately 40 km till Kalagarh, where it enters the fields.</p>
